# 🎧 UrbanSound8K Audio Classification with CNN

This project classifies **urban sounds** (e.g., dog barks, sirens, jackhammers) using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on the [UrbanSound8K dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
Urban sound classification is an important task in environmental monitoring and smart cities.  
The goal of this project is to automatically recognize **10 types of sounds** from short audio clips.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Librosa (audio feature extraction)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (evaluation metrics)

## 🧩 Model Architecture
The CNN consists of:
- 4 convolutional blocks with BatchNorm + MaxPooling
- 2 fully connected dense layers with dropout
- Output layer with 10 softmax neurons

---

## 📈 Results

| Metric | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| Training | 90.62% |
| Validation | 79.66% |
| Test | **73.72%** |

## 🔍 Insights
- The model performs best on distinct sounds (e.g., *gun_shot*, *jackhammer*).  
- Sounds with overlapping frequency patterns (e.g., *engine_idling* vs *air_conditioner*) are harder to distinguish.  
- Further improvement could be achieved with **data augmentation** or **transfer learning**.
